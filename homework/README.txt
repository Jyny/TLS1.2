Homework: Dissecting TLS Packets

        Write a program (in Python or any language you like) to decrypt
        recorded TLS traffic

Assumptions

        1.  The SSL/TLS version is TLS 1.2
        2.  The selected cipher suite is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256

Sample Input (3 files)

        1.  encrypted-traffic-client-to-server
        2.  encrypted-traffic-server-to-client
        3.  long-term-server-private-key

Sample Output (2 files)

        1.  plaintext-traffic-client-to-server
        2.  plaintext-traffic-server-to-client
